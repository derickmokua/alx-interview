# Pascal's Triangle Project

To successfully complete this project, ensure you revise the following key Python concepts:

## Must-Know Concepts

### 1. Lists and List Comprehensions
- Understand list creation, access, modification, and iteration.
- Utilize list comprehensions for concise and readable code, especially for generating Pascal’s Triangle rows.

### 2. Functions
- Know how to define and call functions.
- Pass parameters and return values, particularly for returning a list of lists representing Pascal’s Triangle.

### 3. Loops
- Use `for` and `while` loops for iterating through sequences.
- Nested loops may be necessary for generating rows and calculating values.

### 4. Conditional Statements
- Apply `if`, `elif`, and `else` to implement logic for positions within Pascal’s Triangle, such as the edges always being 1.

### 5. Recursion (Optional)
- Understanding recursion offers an alternative way to generate Pascal’s Triangle.
- Identify base and recursive cases for generating rows.

### 6. Arithmetic Operations
- Perform addition to calculate each element of Pascal’s Triangle by summing the two elements directly above.

### 7. Indexing and Slicing
- Access and slice lists to correctly sum elements when constructing each row.

### 8. Memory Management
- Be aware of how lists are stored and copied, particularly when creating new rows based on previous ones.

### 9. Error and Exception Handling (Optional)
- Use `try-except` blocks to handle potential errors, such as invalid input types.

### 10. Efficiency and Optimization
- Consider the time and space complexity of different approaches to generating Pascal’s Triangle.
- Apply optimizations to improve performance.

By mastering these concepts, you'll be able to implement an efficient and accurate solution for generating Pascal’s Triangle.
