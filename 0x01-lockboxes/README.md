## 1. Lists and List Manipulation
Understanding how to work with lists is essential. This includes:
- Accessing elements
- Iterating over lists
- Modifying lists dynamically

## 2. Graph Theory Basics
While not mandatory, knowledge of **graph theory** can be useful, particularly in understanding:
- Traversal algorithms like Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Thinking of boxes and keys as nodes and edges in a graph

## 3. Algorithmic Complexity
Knowing how to evaluate the time and space complexity of your solution helps in writing efficient algorithms.

## 4. Recursion
Some solutions may require a recursive approach, particularly for traversing through boxes and keys.

## 5. Queue and Stack
Queues and stacks are vital for implementing BFS and DFS algorithms.

## 6. Set Operations
Using sets to track visited boxes and available keys can greatly optimize the search process.
